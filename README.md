## Installing

Execute following command and enter a **supported model** to install.

```sh
# Please replace `<device-id>` with a proper ID.
# And this will be what you are going to query while `$('#<device-id>')`.
rap device add <device-id>

# Then enter a supported model, for example:
# ? model: lcd1602-02
```

### Methods

#### `readCoils(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x01, it is used to read from 1 to 2000 contiguous status of coils in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of coils to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of coils to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `status` as its arguments. The `status` is an array that contains the status of coils.

#### `readDiscreteInputs(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x02, it is used to read from 1 to 2000 contiguous status of discrete inputs in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of discrete inputs to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of discrete inputs to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `status` as its arguments. The `status` is an array that contains the status of discrete inputs.

### `readHoldingRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x03, it is used to read the contents of a contiguous block of holding registers in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of holding registers to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of holding registers to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `status` as its arguments. The `status` is an array that contains the status of holding registers.

### `readInputRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x04, it is used to read from 1 to 125 contiguous input registers in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of input registers to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of input registers to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `status` as its arguments. The `status` is an array that contains the status of input registers.

### `writeSingleCoil(slaveAddress, address, state, callback)`
Function code 0x05, it is used to write a single output to either `ON` or `OFF` in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **address:** The address of coil to be forced to `ON` or `OFF` state.
- **state:** The `ON` or `OFF` state, `1` means `ON` and `0` means `OFF`.
- **callback:** No argument other than a possible error is given to the completion callback.

### `writeSingleRegister(slaveAddress, address, value, callback)`
Function code 0x06, it is used to write a single holding register in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **address:** The address of the holding register to be written.
- **value:** The value to be set to the holding register.
- **callback:** No argument other than a possible error is given to the completion callback.

### `writeMultipleCoils(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, vaules, callback)`
Function code 0x0F, it is used to force each coil in a sequence of coils to either `ON` or `OFF` in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of the coils to be written to.
- **vaules:** The values to be written to the coils. The `values` is an array with `1` or `0` as its element, here `1` means `ON` and `0` means `OFF`.
- **callback:** No argument other than a possible error is given to the completion callback.

### `writeMultipleRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, values, callback)`
Function code 0x10, it is used to write a block of contiguous registers (1 to 123 registers) in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of the registers to be written to.
- **values:** The values to be written to the registers. The `values` is an array with an two bytes value as its element.
- **callback:** No argument other than a possible error is given to the completion callback.
